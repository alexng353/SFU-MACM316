These notes were taken under Professor Steven Ruuth with explicit permission to post them for other students to enjoy. He's a great professor, and if you consider taking MACM316 with him, these notes will be of great use to you. Fair warning though, depending on the class, he may be a few lectures desynchronized from what I have written down.
